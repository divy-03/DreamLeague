# Dream League

Welcome to **Dream League**, a web platform designed to facilitate futsal and football tournaments at our campus. Dream League enables students to register as players, be rated based on their skills and past performances, and participate in an auction where captains bid to form their teams. The platform also tracks and displays tournament statistics, providing an organized and fair team selection process.

## Features

- **User Registration:** Players can sign up and create profiles.
- **Skill Rating:** Admins or hosts rate players out of 5 stars based on their skills and past performances.
- **Captains and Budget Allocation:** A set number of captains (e.g., 10-12) are chosen and given a virtual budget to bid on players.
- **Player Auction:** Players are auctioned, and captains bid for them, aiming to form balanced teams by acquiring players of varying skill levels.
- **Team Formation:** Captains form their teams through the auction process.
- **Tournament Statistics:** Track and display stats such as team compositions, top scorers, points table, and rankings.
